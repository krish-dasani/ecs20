  <p>Hello, I hope that you are able to learn more about the Chicago Bears and more specifically, their quarterback, <font color="red">Mitchell Trubisky</font>. He has been one of my 
   favorite quarterbacks since entering the NFL in 2017; however, the media consistently attacks his ability to lead an offense. Please tell me if there are any 
   bugs that I can fix, Krish.</p>
  <p>I am almost certain that his time with the team will be done after this year, so I want to fill you in on the <b>good parts</b> of his stay in Chicago.
  Especially during this time when we are seeing another quarterback drafted some picks after Trubisky making the superbowl, I want to talk about <u>the legacy</u> that 
   he will leave within the organization.</p>
